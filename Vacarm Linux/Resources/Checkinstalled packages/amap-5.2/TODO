--- late, later than you hope:

* add "common port" support for the "-1" option

* add result database support

* put trigger info into -m output file?

* implement VOTE results

--- In the far away future you are awaiting:

* a graphical GUI

* maybe it should be possible to send triggers after something has been
  received. However, this is not needed at this point.
